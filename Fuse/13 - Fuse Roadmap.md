# $(Fuse Roadmap)

We have big plans for Fuse and UX markup. This section tracks features we are working on, are considering and have rejected.

> This section is being continuously updated.

- System fonts: Fuse is currently unable to use _system fonts_, but that is a feature under development.

Roadmap:
* Observables for Swift
* Observables for Java
